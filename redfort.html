      The Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila, is one of the most iconic monuments of India, located in Old Delhi. Constructed by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1638, the fort served as the main residence of the Mughal rulers for nearly 200 years. It gets its name from the massive red sandstone walls that surround the structure and give it a majestic appearance. Designed as a blend of Persian, Timurid, and Indian architectural styles, the Red Fort stands as a powerful symbol of India's rich cultural and historical heritage.

      Spread across a vast area, the fort complex features many important structures, including the Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audience), Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), Rang Mahal, Mumtaz Mahal, and the famous Lahori Gate. One of its most impressive features is the intricate marble work, floral carvings, and delicate inlay designs that showcase the artistic brilliance of the Mughal craftsmen. The Naubat Khana (Drum House) once hosted royal musicians who played ceremonial music during the emperor’s arrival.

      The Red Fort is not just a historical monument; it also holds great national significance. Every year on India’s Independence Day, the Prime Minister hoists the national flag from its ramparts and addresses the nation. In 2007, the Red Fort was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its architectural importance and cultural value. Today, it remains one of Delhi’s most popular tourist attractions, drawing visitors from all over the world. The evening light-and-sound show inside the fort narrates the history of the Mughal Empire and is especially popular among tourists. With its grand walls, royal halls, and historical charm, the Red Fort continues to stand as a timeless symbol of India’s glorious past.
