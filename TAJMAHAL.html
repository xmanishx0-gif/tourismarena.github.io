    The Taj Mahal, located in Agra, India, is one of the most celebrated architectural masterpieces in the world. Built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, the monument is an enduring symbol of love, beauty, and artistic brilliance. Construction began in 1632 and took around 22 years to complete, involving thousands of artisans, sculptors, stone cutters, and designers. Designed using a blend of Persian, Mughal, and Indian architectural elements, the Taj Mahal is made primarily of white marble that reflects different colors depending on the time of day — pinkish in the morning, milky white during the day, and golden under moonlight.

    One of the most striking features of the Taj Mahal is its perfectly symmetrical structure. The central dome, nearly 35 meters high, is surrounded by four smaller domes and four elegant minarets. The detailed marble carvings, delicate inlay work of semi-precious stones, verses from the Quran, and expertly crafted floral patterns showcase the extraordinary craftsmanship of the Mughal era. The monument stands on a raised platform, giving it a royal presence, while the surrounding Charbagh garden is divided into four sections with flowing water channels and reflecting pools that enhance its beauty from every angle.
