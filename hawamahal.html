      Hawa Mahal, located in Jaipur, Rajasthan, is one of the most iconic landmarks of India. 
      Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the structure was designed by Lal Chand Ustad 
      in the form of Lord Krishna’s crown. Made using red and pink sandstone, the monument is a 
      stunning example of Rajput architecture blended with Mughal influences. Its delicate lattice 
      windows, domed canopies, and extended balconies make it one of the most photographed 
      monuments in the country.

      The name “Hawa Mahal,” which means “Palace of Winds,” comes from its 953 jharokhas 
      (small windows). These windows allowed royal women to view festivals and daily street life 
      without being seen, following the tradition of purdah. The jharokhas also created a natural 
      airflow, keeping the palace cool during Jaipur’s hot summers. This clever ventilation system 
      made the building a comfortable retreat, despite being located in the heart of a bustling city.

      The structure rises five stories high, resembling a honeycomb or a beehive. Interestingly, 
      the palace has no front entrance from the main road; visitors enter from the side through 
      the courtyard. Inside, you will find beautifully painted rooms, fountains, and narrow 
      corridors that lead to the upper floors. The top floors offer a breathtaking view of 
      Jaipur city, including Jantar Mantar and City Palace.

      Today, Hawa Mahal stands as a symbol of Jaipur’s rich cultural and architectural heritage. 
      Tourists from around the world visit to admire its beauty, learn about the royal lifestyle, 
      and enjoy the vibrant atmosphere of the surrounding old city markets. Whether you are 
      exploring Jaipur for history, photography, or culture, Hawa Mahal is a destination 
      you should never miss.
