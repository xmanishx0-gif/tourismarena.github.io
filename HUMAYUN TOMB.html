      Humayun’s Tomb, located in the Nizamuddin East area of Delhi, is one of the most important monuments of the Mughal era. Built in the 16th century, it is considered the first grand garden-tomb on the Indian subcontinent. The monument was commissioned by Empress Bega Begum (also known as Haji Begum), the principal wife of Emperor Humayun, as a tribute of love and devotion after his death. The tomb is a remarkable example of early Mughal architecture, blending Persian influences with Indian craftsmanship. Its massive central dome, symmetrical structure, and beautifully designed Charbagh garden layout inspired many later Mughal monuments, including the world-famous Taj Mahal.

      The tomb was designed by the Persian architect Mirak Mirza Ghiyas, who brought with him the traditional Persian garden style. The complex is built primarily of red sandstone with elegant white marble detailing, creating a striking contrast that enhances its beauty. The Charbagh garden surrounding the tomb is divided into four main sections, with water channels and pathways that give the structure a serene and royal appearance. The monument stands as a perfect example of the Mughal belief in symmetry and balance.

      Apart from the main tomb of Emperor Humayun, the surrounding complex also includes several smaller tombs of Mughal nobles and family members, making it a large historic site. Over the years, the monument has undergone several restoration efforts to preserve its architectural brilliance. Today, Humayun’s Tomb is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and remains one of Delhi’s most visited heritage attractions. Visitors often prefer early morning or evening hours to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere, soft light, and beautiful views for photography. The site represents not only Mughal history but also the evolution of Indo-Persian architecture in India.
