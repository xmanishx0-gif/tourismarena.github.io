      The Lotus Temple, located in New Delhi, is an architectural landmark and a global symbol of unity and peace. Completed in 1986 and designed by Iranian architect Fariborz Sahba, the building takes the form of a blooming lotus flower — a motif that represents purity and spiritual awakening across many cultures. Constructed using white marble and set amid beautifully landscaped gardens and ponds, the temple’s striking form is composed of 27 free-standing marble “petals” arranged in clusters to form nine sides. Its serene exterior combined with reflective pools creates a calm, meditative environment that draws millions of visitors each year.

      As a Bahá'í House of Worship, the Lotus Temple is open to people of all religions and beliefs. Inside, there are no idols, rituals, or sermons; instead the focus is on silent prayer and contemplation. The central hall can seat thousands and is designed to offer excellent acoustics and a tranquil atmosphere. Surrounding galleries and gardens offer spaces for reflection and learning, while exhibitions near the site explain the principles of the Bahá'í faith and highlight India’s cultural heritage. The temple’s inclusive philosophy and minimalist interior underscore its goal of bringing people of diverse backgrounds together in quiet reverence.

      Architecturally and culturally, the Lotus Temple has gained international recognition and several awards for design. Its elegant marble surfaces, thoughtful landscaping, and careful lighting create changing moods throughout the day — warm at sunrise, luminous at noon, and soft during dusk. Visitors are advised to respect the rules (photography restrictions inside the main hall, quiet conduct) to preserve the sanctity of the place. Whether appreciated for its design, spirituality, or peaceful gardens, the Lotus Temple remains one of Delhi’s most visited and admired modern monuments.
